# ABSTRACT
The  automated  rain  wiper system  is  used  to detect  rainfall  and  activate  automobile  automatic rain  wipers  without  driver  interaction.  The  system was  developed  to  mitigate  driving  distractions  and allow  drivers  to  focus  on  their  primary  task  of driving.    The    distraction    eliminated    with    the development    of    this    product    is    the    manual adjustment  of  windshield  wipers  when  driving  in precipitation.  The  few  seconds  that  a  driver  takes their  attention  off  the  road  to  adjust  a  knob  while driving     in     poor     weather     conditions     could potentially lead to car accidents. The system uses a combination  of  impedance  and  Impedance  sensor to detect rain and its intensity. The system contains a  controller that  takes in the  input signals  from the sensors    and    controls    the    operation    of    the windshield  wipers  based  on  those  input  signals. The   prototype   demonstration   shows   the basic operation of the system in standard conditions. The system  responded  successfully  to  rain  simulations within the specified amount of time.
